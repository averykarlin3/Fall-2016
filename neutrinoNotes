Neutrino source above muon production threshold - Background
Hadronic system - Background = baryon/meson produced
Why can't the electrons be captured from electron neutrinos

Does oxygen only capture one type of muon? - only negative muons in a specific fraction

Gadolinium captures the neutrons which are released by the oxygen
What does the purity of the sample mean/why is high purity required
Eliminates the neutrino energy factor, only distance/flavor

Neutrino fluxes?
