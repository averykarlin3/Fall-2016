Neutrino source above muon production threshold - Background
Hadronic system - Background = baryon/meson produced
Why can't the electrons be captured from electron neutrinos

Does oxygen only capture one type of muon? - only negative muons in a specific fraction

Gadolinium captures the neutrons which are released by the oxygen
What does the purity of the sample mean/why is high purity required
Eliminates the neutrino energy factor, only distance/flavor

Neutrino fluxes?

How do we know not massless
What does massive neutrinos imply with standard model
Meaning of mass inhibiting structure

Mixing angle determined by nature?

Capture frequency postulated to be independent of neutrino energy, gain percentage of neutrons of neutrino and anti-neutrino within a sample

Purity meaning and purpose?

1/2. What software exists currently
3. Within what programming paradigm
5. Meaning of calibrating the experiment
