\section{Freegarde Chapter 1 - Wave Motion Essence}
\begin{outline*}
\1 Physics can be viewed by Lagrangian Particle Theory or Euler Field Theory, as a duality of perspectives, most apparent on a quantum scale
\2 As a result, when considering a dynamic/time-dependent system, it becomes Kinetic Theory and Wave Theory respectively
\1 Waves are defined microscopically as a collective bulk disturbance, created at a point as a delayed response to the disturbance at adjacent points
\2 The disturbance progression to adjacent points is called the propagation, going through the medium
\2 The medium does not need to be linear, homogeneous, with sinusoidal or periodic propagation to classify as a wave
\2 Positions in the medium are defined by coordinates, each position requiring at least one additional variable to describe the disturbance
\3 The coordinates and disturbance variables are each wavefunctions, defined with respect to time
\1 Waves must be viewed in terms of both cause and effect, such that it is defined macroscopically as a time-dependent field effect due to finite speed of propagation of a causal effect
\2 Thus, it can be viewed as the solution to systems in dynamic equilibrium, more generalized than static equilibrium theory
\2 Electric Coulomb waves can thus be viewed as a result of a rotating dipole acting on a single charge at some distance
\3 If the dipole radius is assumed to be far less than the distance from the charge, it can be simplified such that $E(t) = \frac{2kq}{r_0^3}a(t - \frac{r_0}{c}$
\4 a(t) is the perpendicular height of each side of the dipole, while $r_0$ is the distance from the center of the dipole to the particle
\4 The time delay due to the relativistic limitations on which the change in force is received create the time lag/retardation, allowing the wave
\4 The magnetic component of electromagnetic waves are found by a Lorentz transformation taking into account the motion of the charges and dipoles themselves
\3 Gravitational waves have a similar wave effect for a gravitational single body, such that $g = \frac{Gm}{r_0^3}a(t - \frac{r_0}{c})$
\4 On the other hand, since the rotation of the causal body requires a third body to rotate with it similar to a dipole, it results for similar bodies in a higher order (inverse fourth root law), canceling out the effect to some degree
\4 Thus, it is found that g = $\frac{2Gma_0^2}{r_0^4}sin(2\omega t)$ assuming the distance between the two causal bodies is vastly smaller
\2 As a result, waves can be viewed as some function dependent on an action at a prior time at some other object
\1 It was believed until the 1900s that objects required a medium to influence each other in a vacuum, leading to the idea of the aether
\2 As a result of relativity and electromagnetism, it became apparent that there is no ether, such that forces can be sent through a vacuum
\2 On the other hand, for waves, there remains the concern of diffraction in a vacuum, with apparently nothing deflecting, and the concept of radiation, sending energy through a vacuum alone
\3 Current theories create no issues with these concepts, though they remain difficult to conceptualize
\1 Transverse wave motions, such as surface tension, electromagnetic, or gravitational, where the disturbance is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation
\2 Longitudinal waves are those where the disturbance is parallel to the direction of propagation, such as sound, generally due to pressure differences on each side
\3 On the other hand, gravitational or electromagnetic waves can be created longitudinal rather than transverse
\2 Spin waves are those with both transverse and longitudinal components, such as seismology
\2 Waves can also be scalar quantity displacement, such as thermal waves (based on heat transfer), quantum wavefunction, or chemical composition waves (based on a reaction-diffusion system)
\2 Waves are also not required to be moving through a continuous medium, as long as they fulfill the definition
\end{outline*}
\section{Freegarde Chapter 2 - Basic Wave Equations}
\subsection{General Concepts}
\begin{outline*}
\1 Wave equations are partial differential equations which relate the wavefunction (derivatives of wave displacement) to time and position, derived first from the general physical situation
\1 It is found that for traveling waves, the shape remains the same though the location of the disturbance changes with time
\2 This is due to the lack of loss of energy during propagation, such that there is no dissipation/damping of the wave
\2 As a result, it is found that $\psi(x, t) = \psi(x - \delta x, t - \delta t) = \psi(x - v\delta t, t - \delta t)$, since $\delta x = v \delta t$
\3 Thus, if $\delta t = t$, $\psi(x, t) = \psi(x - vt, 0) = \psi(u)$, such that the variables must appear in that combination for a forward traveling wave
\3 Thus, since the wavefunction is the same value over a specific curve, this single variable function is found for a traveling wave
\3 This all follows from the method of viewing waves as the motions of individual particles, collectivized, such that x determines which particle is being viewed, while t is at which time
\2 In addition, both sides can be subtracted by $\phi(x, t - \delta t)$, by the x-t relation, such that $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = -v \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}$
\3 This assumes that $\phi$ is continuous, or at least can be approximated as a continuous function
\3 Further, it is found similarly that $\frac{\partial^n \phi}{\partial t^n} = (-v)^n \frac{\partial^n \phi}{\partial x^n}$, though the equation would have to be modified due to the sign of n changing
\1 Generally, wave motion may be done relating the derivative with respect to time at some point to that relating the derivative with respect to location at that time
\2 This is then used to determine the general form of the wave equation, followed by inputting specific parameters for the solution
\end{outline*}
\subsection{Long String Waves}
\begin{outline*}
\1 For some string with tension T, assuming gravity effect is negligible, such that for some unit length mass M with length $\delta x$, tension is acting on both sides
\2 The angle is assumed to be slightly varying on the sides of the length, with small enough total displacement that $cos\theta_1 \approx cos\theta_2 \approx 1$
\3 Since the tension on the side in the direction of the wave is toward the positive wave function, while it is toward the negative for the other at some point, $F_{perpendicular} = T(sin\theta_2 - sin\theta_1)$
\3 When this distance is infinitesimal, the change in angle for each side is infinitesimal, moving the wave toward the slightly steeper direction
\2 By definition of the angle, $tan\theta = \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}$ for each end of $\delta x$
\3 Since the angles are small enough that $cos\theta \approx 1$, it can be stated that $sin\theta \approx tan\theta$
\3 As a result by this and Newton's Law, $F_n = T(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}_{x_2} - \frac{\psi}{\partial x}_{x_1}) = M\delta x (\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial t^2}|_x)$
\4 This is due to the fact that the acceleration at any one point is equal to the wave function second derivative with respect to time
\3 Thus, as divided by the length and taken to the limit as the length approaches 0, it is found that $\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial t^2} = \frac{T}{M}\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2}$
\1 Using the formula for traveling waves in terms of one variable combined with the chain rule and the above formula, it is found that $v^2 \frac{d^2 \psi}{du^2} = \frac{T}{M} \frac{d^2 \psi}{du^2}$
\2 Thus, for a traveling string wave, $v = \pm \sqrt{\frac{T}{M}}$, such that the velocity depends on the tension and density
\1 Since the wave equation has linearity, such that superposition applies to it, the general solution is equal to the linear combination of individual solutions, spanning the solution set
\2 Thus, the two respective solutions are for a positive and negative velocity traveling waves, such that it is equal to the solution to a wave with positive and negative velocity
\3 Thus, this forms the idea that since the velocity can be in either direction when assuming a standing wave, all waves on the string are made up of two standing wave directions
\2 Thus, it is found that $\psi(x, t) = \psi(x \pm vt) = \psi_+(x - |v|t) + \psi_-(x + |v|t)$, to provide the forward and backward wave components, taking the specific solution at t = 0
\3 The constant multipliers of the linear multiplier are contained within the functions themselves
\3 This forms $\psi(x, 0) = \psi_+(x) + \psi_-(x)$ and by the derivative with respect to t, $\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}(x, 0) = \frac{\partial \psi_+ (x - |v|t)}{\partial t}(x, 0) + \frac{\partial \psi_- (x + |v|t)}{\partial t}(x, 0)$
\4 The first equation serves to provide the initial condition for a unique solution
\3 By the chain rule, the second equation becomes $\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}(x, 0) = |v|(\frac{d\psi_-(x)}{dx} - \frac{d\psi_+(x)}{dx})$
\2 For some guitar string connected at two ends, [0, l], pulled at some point $x_0$ to initial height $a_0$ at t = 0, with initial velocity of 0
\3 By integrating the velocity formula for t = 0, $\psi_-(x) = \psi_+(x) + c$, such that at t = 0, $\psi(x, 0) = 2\psi_+(x) + c = 2\psi_-(x) - c$
\1 By these formulas for $\psi_\pm$ in terms of the initial wavefunction of some point, $\psi(x, t) = \frac{1}{2}\psi(x - |v|t, 0) + \frac{1}{2}\psi(x + |v|t, 0)$
\2 It follows from this and the general formula that the separate wave components are equal to half of the initial wavefunction, moving in each respective direction
\2 This assumes that x is not at the endpoints at some nonzero time, since it is undefined for a negative displacement or a displacement greater than the length
\2 This equations can be supplemented by the fact that $\psi(0, t) = \psi(l, t) = 0$ for any time t, acting as a boundary condition
\2 This is used to find the restriction that for any x, t, $\psi_+(x - |v|t) = -\psi_-(2l - x + |v|t) = \psi_+(x - |v|t - 2l)$, such that the component waves are periodic triangular/sawtooth
\3 This is found by the fact that $u_+ = 2x - u_i$, giving the relationship between the component functions if the overall function is 0, such that $u_+ = -u_i$ and $u_+ = 2l - u_-$ must be true for all u by the boundary conditions
\1 The wave solution must be valid for the entire domain of x, t values which are possible, to be a solution
\end{outline*}
\subsection{Light Properties}
\begin{outline*}
\1 By Maxwell's equations, the wave equation for light is derived, such that $\frac{\partial B_z}{\partial x} = \mu_0\epsilon_0 \frac{\partial E_y}{\partial t}$, such that it is solved to find that $c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0\epsilon_0}}$
\2 This results also in the fields oscillating sinusoidally, perpendicularly, and transversely in phase with each other
\2 In addition, by Maxwell's equations, it is found that $E = cB$ at any point in the wave, giving a relationship between the amplitudes
\2 Similarly, within other mediums, $v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu\epsilon}} = \frac{1}{\kappa\epsilon_0 k_m\mu_0}$, where $\kappa$ is the dielectric constant and $k_m$ is the relative permeability
\3 $k_m$ is generally equal to 1 for dielectrics, such that it can be ignored
\3 This provides a relationship between these constants and the index of refraction, such that $n = \sqrt{\kappa k_m} = \sqrt{\kappa}$, such that $\kappa$ is a function of 
\1 By Maxwell's equations, the energy density for each field is found such that $u = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0E^2 + \frac{1}{2\mu_0}B^2 = \epsilon_0E^2$
\2 $S = \epsilon_0E^2c = \frac{EB}{\mu_0}$, such that the Poynting vector is the vector power in the direction of propogation, $\vec{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0}\vec{E}\times\vec{B}$
\2 The intensity is equal to the average of the Poynting vector as a result, such that $I = <S> = \frac{E_{max}B_{max}}{2\mu_0} = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0cE_{max}^2$, with total power as $P = \int IA$
\end{outline*}
\section{Freegarde Chapter 4 - Sinusoidal Waveforms}
\begin{outline*}
\1 Sinusoidal wave solutions are often used to approximate a wave, such that while they are not the only form of motion, can be used to form any linear wavemotion
\2 Pseudo-sinusoidal equations are also used for dissipative systems, able to be described generally by a main sinusoidal component
\1 The main sinusoidal wave form, fulfilling the traveling wave criteria, is $\psi(x, t) = asin(k(x - vt) + \phi)$, where $\phi$ is the initial phase/offset (relative to an origin) and a is the amplitude
\2 As a result, the wave angular frequency, $\omega = vk = kf\lambda$, where k is the constant wavenumber, continuing infinitely
\2 This can be rewritten by several variables, oscillation period ($\tau f = 1$), frequency ($\omega = 2\pi f$), wavelength ($k\lambda = 2\pi$), or the spectroscopists' wavenumber ($\bar{v}\lambda = 1$)
\1 Wavefronts are defined as a continuous function with constant sinusoidal phase, such that for the main form, $k(x - vt) + \phi = c$ for some constant c
\2 As a result, since it describes the movement of a point of constant wavefunction over the function over time ($x = vt + (c - \phi)k$)
\2 This includes the crest of a wave, or a point where the wavefunction remains 0, or a point that moves with the wave, keeping constant displacement
\2 The velocity of the wavefront, moving with constant phase, is called the phase velocity, denoted $v_p$, commonly just as v
\1 For some traveling string wave (u = x - vt), assuming amplitude is far smaller than wavelength and tension is constant, kinetic energy is by the transverse motion ($v_t = \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}$)
\2 Thus, $K = \frac{1}{2}\delta m v_t^2 = \frac{M \delta x}{2}(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t})^2$, by chain rule, $K = \frac{v_p^2M\delta x}{2}(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial u})^2$
\3 Due to lack of longitudinal motion, each mass item is constant per unit length, and kinetic energy is purely transverse
\2 Potential energy of a string element is the work done stretching the string to displace it, creating the tension
\3 As a result, U = $\frac{T\delta x}{2}(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x})^2$, by the chain rule, U = $\frac{T\delta x}{2}(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial u})^2$
\3 Thus, potential and kinetic energy of any length element are equal, such that $E = K + U = T(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x})^2\delta x = T(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial u})^2\delta x$
\2 The energy density, $\epsilon$, is the energy per unit length
\2 This is an example of the virial theorem, stating that potential and kinetic energy are related for any dynamic system
\3 In addition, this shows that both forms of energy are related to the square of the wave amplitude
\2 As a result, the intensity is the energy moving through some point with the wave at some moment, or the power at some point such that $I = Tv_p(\frac{d\psi}{du})^2 = \epsilon v_p$
\3 Thus, intensity is defined as the energy propogating through some point per unit time, such that total power through the region is $P = \int IA$
\2 It is noted that for superpositioned waves, the intensity and energy must take into account the sums of various directions of each
\1 Sinusoidal waves are generally used as an ideal solution class to the wave equations, due to commonality, but relying on a single frequency to be able to define phase velocity
\2 On the other hand, it is ideal due to acting as solutions to linear, dispersive systems with varying phase velocity as well, and due to standing waves and orthogonality
\1 Standing waves are a class of solutions to a non-dispersive, linear string system, in which the motion is standard, differing only in magnitude throughout the string
\2 As a result, it can be written in the format of $\psi(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$, placed within the string wave function to get two second order ODEs, forming sinusoidal solutions if X, T, and k are real
\2 In this case, $X(x) = X_0sin(kx + \phi), T(t) = T_0sin(\omega t + \theta)$, where $\omega/v_p$ are constant based on string characteristics
\3 Thus, $\psi(x, t) = \psi_0 sin(kx + \phi)sin(\omega t + \theta)$, where $\psi_0 = T_0X_0$
\2 These appear as non-moving waves, though by the trigonometric identities, can be converted to the sum of sinusoidal travelling waves, creating an alternate wave format
\2 Nodes of a standing wave are points where motion is always 0, such that $kx_m + \phi = m\pi$, where m is an integer, able to be fixed at those points without changing the wave
\3 Thus, for some fixed string of length l, assuming no phase shift, $k = \frac{n\pi}{l}$, where n is some integer, or $l = \frac{n\lambda}{2}$
\3 As a result, the allowed modes of vibration of a standing wave are all lengths of integer n for some wavelength
\4 For n = 1, it is the fundamental mode of vibration/first harmonic, while higher modes are harmonics/overtones (n = 2, the second harmonic, first overtone)
\3 Nodes can also be determined by the superposition of forward and backward travelling waves, such that if $\psi_+(u) = \psi_0 cos(ku)$, for each node, it must be true by boundary conditions that $\psi_+(u - 2x)$
\4 As a result, it must be true that $kx = n\pi$ where n is some integer
\4 This is able to be taken as well, such that $\psi_-(u) = -\psi_0 cos(k(x + |v|t))$, the standing wave equation can be derived
\2 The energy over an entire string, $E = T(\int (a\frac{\partial \psi_1}{\partial x} + b\frac{\partial \psi_2}{\partial x})^2)$, expanded to find that $E = a^2E_1 + b^2E_2 + 2Tab\int^l_0 \frac{\partial \psi_1}{\partial x}\frac{\partial \psi_2}{\partial x}dx$
\3 As a result, it is found that the energy is greater than the sum of the component energies
\3 On the other hand, it is found that sinusoidal functions, $sin(k_1x), sin(k_2x)$ have the integrated product of 0 if the functions are linearly independent, called orthogonal, making them ideal for energy analysis
\end{outline*}
\section{Freegarde Chapter 5 - Complex Wavefunctions}
\begin{outline*}
\1 Sinusoidal wave forms, due to the cycle of derivatives, are those with wavefunctions of the form $\sum_{n_i, n_j, \dots} a_{n_i, n_j, \dots} \frac{\partial^{n_i + n_j + \dots}\psi}{\partial x_i^{n_i} \partial x_j^{n_j} \dots} = 0$
\2 This assumes that the order of the sum of partial derivatives are all even or all odd ($n_i + n_j + \dots$)
\2 The main wave types not with sinusoidal wave forms, are dissipative waves, thermal diffusion equation, and the Schrodinger quantum equation, which are not all odd or even, and thus not fully sinusoidal
\3 In other cases, the complex harmonic waveform is used, such that it is a well-defined sinusoidal function, but with possibly imaginary amplitudes
\2 For some complex wavefunction, $\psi(x, t) = acos(kx - \omega t) + iasin(kx - \omega t) = ae^{i(kx - \omega t)}$, such that it is a travelling wave where $u = k(x - v_pt)$, and can be broken separably
\3 This can be proven to be the solution to any wavefunction, with any partial derivative sum parity
\3 It can also thus be broken up into a separable standing wave function, breaking the exponents up
\3 It can be superimposed with other complex exponentials to produce a real sinusoidal wave, allowing for easier calculation
\2 For some dissipative system, such as a string wave with a drag force, such that $F = -\mu v_t$, solved to find $k = \pm \sqrt{\frac{M}{T}}\omega\sqrt{1 + \frac{\mu i}{M \omega}} = \pm k_0(p + iq)$
\3 This can then be solved for the real and imaginary parts, such that $p^2 = \frac{1}{2}(1 + \sqrt{1 + (\frac{\mu}{M\omega})^2}), q = \frac{\mu}{2M\omega}$
\3 Weak damping is if $p \approx 1$, such that $\mu << M\omega$ and $\psi = ae^{i(k_0x - \omega t)}e^{-k_0qx}$, where $k_0q$ is the decay constant
\3 This provides the spatial decay wave equation, though it can be rewritten to create a complex $\omega$ and real k for the temporally decaying form
\3 These equations can also be solved by complex standing wave form of each standing wave part, separating the variables, creating a single variable differential equation for the same function
\3 These display dispersion as a result, changing the shape during propagation, rather than being a constant travelling wave, such that phase velocity and angular frequency are dependent on wave number
\4 As a result, dispersive waves are only sinusoidal travelling waves if the wavenumber is constant
\1 The displacement due to sinusoidal wave motion at some point is drawn with a phasor arrow, proportional in length to amplitude
\2 The phasor is rotated to show the phase of the wave propagation, able to be represented as a complex exponential, providing the time difference between each neighbor effect
\2 The phasors are thus able to be added as vectors, providing the overall wave displacement at some point
\3 For phasors of constant phase difference, it becomes an infinite geometric series, decreasing in magnitude from the original amplitude, such as light reflecting on oil
\3 The light is then reflected partially at the bottom of the oil to the top, repeating infinitely, summing for the net effect
\end{outline*}
\section{Freegarde Chapter 6 - Huygens Wave Propagation}
\subsection{Huygens Description}
\begin{outline*}
\1 Huygen's principle states that a wavefront of light propagates from an initial disturbance at the speed of light, equally in all directions, to form a spherical wavefront
\2 This has since been expanded to apply to all forward-traveling waves, rather than just light waves
\2 It also states that as the wavefront moves, it creates secondary sources, forming secondary wavefronts, being created at all positions continuously
\2 As a result of interference, adding the amplitudes as superposition of waves from different paths to enforce or cancel out others
\3 This results in the lack of backwards travelling waves, averaging to cancel each other out in that direction, superposed purely on the advancing planar wavefront
\4 This creates a wavefront tangent to the secondary wavelets, where the set of wavelets is the envelope of the wavelets
\3 This can be shown by phasars for each wavefront at some point, the central waves at the lowest angle due to being the first, and so forth
\4 This can be mathematically analyzed by finding the exponential function, $a(x, y) = \frac{e^{ikr}}{r}, r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, such that the amplitude is the inverse square dependent on the distance
\4 This can then be taken for all points at the same x value, integrated, to get the overall amplitude at that point
\4 It is found to be proportional to the Fresnel integral, $\int^\infty_{-\infty} e^{iks^2}ds$, where $r - x = s^2$ if kx >> 1
\4 The Cornu/Euler Spiral/Clothoid is the graph on the complex plane of the result of $a_0(s_0) = \int^{s_0}_0 e^{iks^2}ds$ for all $s_0$, graphing the line from the ends of the curve for the Fresnel integral vector
\4 This as a result approximates to a resultant with a phase of $\frac{\pi}{4}$
\3 Huygen's description implies a backward-travelling wavefront similarly, acting as a snapshot mechanism, such that each wavefront is replaced by the new wavefront of subsequent sources
\4 This is due to the velocity for the wave being of equal importance to the displacement at some point, for determining the wave, providing the initial conditions for a specific solution
\4 Thus, the lack of a specific mechanism or velocity of propagation prevents a specific waveform from being determined
\4 For electromagnetic waves, the electric and magnetic fields provide the displacement and velocity, the cross product being the Poynting vector of the direction of energy propagation
\4 It can also be explained by the forward wave producing secondary waves in phase with each other, while the backwards secondary waves don't produce in phase, but rather at any point after
\3 The Fresnel integral vector is found to have a $\frac{\pi}{4}$ angle/phase, doubled for a 2D wave, as the basis of Fresnel-Kirchhoff diffraction theory
\4 It could also be attributed to some degree to an overly literally derived mathematical model of Huygen's description, but can also be derived by Maxwell's equations
\4 In addition, if the assumption of kx >> 1 is false, the value collapses towards the real value in the direction of the wavefront
\1 Huygen's principle is not independent, but rather a means of calculating wave phenomena, able to be separately derived for individual wave types
\end{outline*}
\subsection{Geometric Properties}
\begin{outline*}
\1 Reflection is explained as creating secondary wavefronts at the collision with the surface, spreading outward, the waves hitting the mirror moving further, creating a new horizontal wavefront
\2 It can be then found geometrically that the wavefronts are at equal angles to the normal of the surface of the mirror, creating the Law of Reflection
\3 The rays are considered to be propagating in the plane of incidence, perpendicular to the material boundary
\2 This prevents the backward-travelling waves from being canceled out and it blocks/disrupts the forward travelling waves
\2 Reflection at a definite angle of a smooth surface is specular reflection, while a rough surface causes diffuse reflection
\2 Reflection takes place in all types of materials, allowing them to be seen by the colors reflected
\1 Refraction is described similarly, though it only partially disrupts the forward travelling wave
\2 It must take into account the relative speeds within each medium, such that the distances are based on time, such that the wave travels at a different velocity within the new medium, causing the angle change
\2 It is thus partially reflected, but forms a wave within the border, such that the angles must be specifically to allow the same time with different velocity
\1 The relationship between the angles and velocity are embodied by Snell's law of refraction, commonly written in terms of a refractive index, $\eta$ of the medium, such that $\eta = \frac{c}{v_p} \geq 1$, such that if $\theta$ is the angle from the normal line, $\eta_1 sin(\theta_1) = \eta_2 sin(\theta_2)$
\2 Gradual changes in the velocity, rather than at an interface, causes refraction, though not reflection since there is no sudden medium shift to trigger reflection, changing due to the density shift, such as in the atmosphere, creating mirages
\2 The refractive index is distinct for different materials and since all real waves are dispersive, since the velocity depends on the wavelength/wavenumber, the index of refraction does as well
\3 It follows that since $v = \lambda f$, if $\lambda_0$ is the wavelength in a vacuum, $\lambda = \frac{\lambda_0}{\eta}$
\2 As a result of this law, the path of a ray is reversible, moving by the same path in the other direction
\2 It is possible for all light to be reflected from a non-opaque medium shift if the resultant angle is $90^o$, called the critical angle, such that above that, none can be refracted
\3 This is called total internal reflection, only able to occur if the index of refraction of the original medium is larger than that of the other medium, such that there is no refraction
\3 This allows a hollow Porro prism (45-90-45) to internally reflect all light within to each of the legs of the prism, due to air/glass having a lower critical angle
\3 This also allows a light pipe, such as a fiber optic cable of glass or plastic, to transmit an image, built so the angles are all greater than the critical angle, acting as a thinner and more insulator than normal wires
\1 Fermat's Principle of Least Time is distinct from, but consistant with, the Huygens construction, stating that a wave follows the path that takes the least time when travelling between two points
\2 The path is defined as the ray path, either of a narrow beam from a slit blocking the light wave, larger than a wavelength, smaller than the main components, such that there are enough secondary sources for the wavefront, but a narrow wavefront
\3 This can also be viewed as the direction of energy flow or as the normal to the wavefront
\2 This is found to coorespond to Snell's Law if applied to a medium transition, such that refraction produces the path of least time
\3 This can be thought of in terms of phasars, such that phasars of longer time vary more in direction, cancelling each other out, such that only the shortest time remain
\2 This law is akin to the Principle of Least Action in mechanics, such that the same law applies to particles as well as waves to an extent
\1 Dispersion is the dependence of wave speed and index of refraction on wavelength, not taking place in a vacuum, allowing light to be dispersed/separated into a spectrum when diffracted
\2 The amount of dispersion depends on the difference between the refractive indices, causing diamonds to have large dispersion
\1 Rainbows are created partially from light being partially refracted, refracted, and dispersed, most reflected into some angle less than $\theta$, the majority at $\theta$
\2 The down-sun point is the point at which for some drop of water, the horizontal axis intersects the angle, generally outside the drop, appearing as the bright line of the rainbow
\3 The angle depends on the refractive index for each wavelength, such that it is the angle light at the top of the drop reflects to for the primary rainbow, bottom for secondary
\3 For purple light, refracted the most, the angle is approximately $42^o$
\2 The primary rainbow has one reflection and two refractions, while the secondary rainbow has two reflections and two refractions, with larger angle for each wavelength ($52^o$ for red)
\2 The secondary rainbow as a result has reversed colors, with the areas between the primary and secondary and above the secondary darker than the rest, due to far fewer light waves
\3 The second rainbow is fainter due to less light remaining after two reflections causing some diffracted
\1 Polarization is a characteristic of all transverse waves, linearly polarized if there is only displacement on one axis, performed by polarizing filters
\2 Polarizing filters can be thin slits to stop strings in any other direction, or metal/long-chain-molecule slits to absorb all electric fields in those directions by free electrons canceling it out
\3 Polaroid filters are dichroismic materials, such that it transmits 80\% of the waves on the polarizing axis, and only 1\% otherwise
\3 Ideal polarizing filters are those which transmit all light on the polarizing axis
\2 Radio waves are linearly polarized parallel to the antenna, but other emitted light is due to random molecule orientation, such that it is unpolarized/natural light
\2 Malus's Law states that since for two polarizers (the second called an analyzer) with some angle $\theta$ between the axes, $\vec{E} = \vec{E}_{max}cos\theta$, such that $I = I_{max}cos^2\theta$
\2 Light is also able to be partially polarized by reflection, due to light with electric fields parallel to the surface being reflected more
\3 There is also some angle, the polarizing angle, such that all light is refracted, rather than reflected, except those parallel to the surface, which has some reflected
\4 In addition, refracted light from this angle is partially polarized by that mainly perpendicular to the surface in the same manner
\3 Brewster's law states that the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular at the polarizing angle, such that $tan(\theta_p) = \frac{n_b}{n_a}$
\3 This allows sunglasses to work better, polarizing to remove light that is reflected off the horizontal ground to reduce the light
\2 Circular/elliptical polarization is caused by polarized transverse waves perpendicular to each other, out of phase, such that each point has circular motion, appearing as a spiral
\3 For a quarter phase difference, it is circular, while otherwise, it is elliptical, while as the wave moves towards the viewer, the direction of rotation is right if clockwise, left otherwise
\3 This can be done by an antenna by adding a delay for one of two perpendicular antennas from the transmitter
\3 Materials with different indices of refraction for different polarizations are birefringent, dependent on the material and the wavelength of light
\4 This is able to produce the phase difference for perpendicularly polarized light, due to the different velocity within for each polarization
\4 Crystals such as calcite which are thick enough to produce a quarter phase difference are called quarter-wave plates
\4 Photoelasticity is the property of materials to become birefringent when under stress, allowing light to move through perpendicular polarizers if passing through a stressed object between
\1 Scattering is the process of atoms absorbing and reradiating light, such that blue is scattered downward more, leading to the red sunset of light not scattered, but the blue sky
\2 This collision polarizes the light, due to the molecule oscillating like an antenna, propagating in every other direction than the original wave, due to no electric field in that direction
\3 It then sends waves in the direction of oscillation, such that the waves in those directions are polarized
\2 It is found that $I_{scattered} = kf^4$, such that higher frequencies are scattered more
\2 Higher concentrations generally appear white, due to all wavelengths eventually scattering within
\end{outline*}
\section{Freegarde Chapter 7 - Geometric Optics}
\begin{outline*}
\1 Geometric optics are the movement of a ray/wavefront moving in a straight line, and the effects of a change in medium, predating physical optics which requires wave behavior
\2 Optics are generally the study of electromagnetic waves/light
\2 Until Newton, light was believed to be a string of particles emitted, though as it displayed properties of waves, the consensus changed until Maxwell proved it was an electromagnetic wave
\3 It was later found that light was in discrete quanta, or photons, displaying wave-particle duality, leading to the study of quantum electrodynamics
\3 As a result, propagation is generally studied as a wave, while absorption and emission are studied as particles
\2 Wavefronts, while realistically somewhat curved, can be viewed on some small area relative to the total size of the wavefront, as a planar wave
\1 For some glass sphere, the paraxial approximation states that the angle made by any ray to the sphere is small, and the thin-lens approximation states that the distance from the horizontal axis is smaller than the radius
\2 Situations where the approximations do not apply are considered optical aberrations, preventing the height from being ignored
\2 The sphere is made up of a sphere connected to a continuing medium, found geometrically that $\frac{\eta_1}{d_1} + \frac{\eta_2}{d_2} = \frac{\eta_2 - \eta_1}{R}$
\3 $d_1$ is the distance from the ray origin on the axis to the point of refraction $d_2$ is the distance from when the diffracted ray hits the axis to the image, and R is the radius
\3 It is noted that it is independent of the height from the horizontal axis at which the ray hits the sphere
\3 The focus of the rays is the point at which the rays are refracted to, reversible, such that the points are images of each other
\3 It is also found that the same point is valid for all rays from a particular initial axis point
\2 For some point at the same distance from the sphere, but either above or below the axis, it is mapped as if the axis was rotated
\3 This creates a correspondence between each point, such that it creates image formation in the sphere, flipped in orientation
\2 The existence of a focal point at which all the rays converge produces a real image, allowing it to be recorded
\3 For some critical distance, the rays are parallel, such that they intersect at infinity, and no image is produced
\4 This distance is called the focal length, $f_n = \frac{\eta_{n}R}{\eta_2 - \eta_1}$, where n is the medium, $\eta_2$ is the sphere, $\eta_1$ is the other medium
\3 For a greater distance, they diverge from some point beyond the original source, called a virtual image
\3 Due to the images being reversible, the sources/objects can be real or virtual, either from a physical object or an image object
\3 Negative sources and images are denoted with a negative distance, positive if real, with the radius positive for a source outside the interface, negative for within
\1 Two spheres of different curvatures/radii are often combined to send the image into the original medium on the opposite side, called a lens
\2 Lenses can have each side calculated for diffraction, combined with the thin lens approximation, to give the lensmaker's formula, such that $\frac{1}{s_1} + \frac{1}{p_2} = \frac{\eta_2 - \eta_1}{\eta_1}(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2})$
\3 $s_1$ is the distance from the object to the lens, while $p_2$ is the distance from the lens to the image, defined purely by the lens properties
\3 For either an infinitely distant image or source, one term can be removed, such that $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{\eta_2 - \eta_1}{\eta_1}(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}$
\3 As a result, it can also be written as $\frac{1}{s} + \frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{f}$
\2 Converging lenses are those with a positive focal length, while those with a negative focal length are diverging lenses
\2 This can be extended to a spherical mirror, such that $\eta_1 = -\eta_2$ to describe reflection, with $R_1 = R_2$
\3 As a result, $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{-2}{R} = \frac{1}{s} + \frac{1}{p}$, such that the focal length is half the curvature radius
\3 This applies to both forms of mirrors, such that R is positive if the image is outside the radius interface, negative otherwise
\1 The focal plane is the plane that passes perpendicular to the lens axis, such that the angle of the parallel rays to the lens axis is based on the initial height of the object in the plane
\2 Thus, it is determined by the Gaussian lens equation that $y = f\theta$
\1 Fermat's principle states that while there is no preferred direction, rays travel the path of least time, such that all ray paths take the same time to reach the image point from some source
\2 As a result, the initial direction by which a ray is emitted is independent of the time to reach the image
\2 The image can thus be defined as the point in which all rays from a source are in phase together
\end{outline*}
\section{Freegarde Chapter 8 - Interference}
\begin{outline*}
\1 Wave interference and superposition state that the field can be added for all different wave paths at a specific point
\2 The theory of interference ignores the phase differences and use the paraxial approximation again to allow angle approximations, preventing the measurement at the interference directly
\2 Young's analysis of interference also assumes a specific frequency to allow use of phasors by sinusoidal components
\1 Young observed that light shined into opaque cardboard with two slits within, showed periodic spacial intensity
\2 This was due to allowing only a single secondary wave source for each slit, such that the phasor sum of the secondary waves produced the periodic nature
\2 For some slits at $x = 0, y_{1/2} = \pm \frac{d}{2}$, $\psi(x,y) = \psi_1(x,y) + \psi_2(x,y)$, where $\psi_{1/2} = \frac{\psi_0}{r_{1/2}}e^{ikr_{1/2}}$
\3 This is due to the phasors acting as the components for superpositioned waves, producing constructive and destructive interference, proving wave behavior
\3 $r_{1/2} = r_0\sqrt{1 + \frac{\mp d + \frac{d^2}{4}}{r_0^2}}$ where $r_0$ is the distance from the center of the slit sheet
\4 If $d << r_0$, this approximates that $r_{1/2} = r_0(1 + \mp \frac{dy}{2r^2_0})$, and $\psi(x, y) = 2\frac{\psi_0}{r_0}e^{ikr_0}cos(k\frac{d}{2r_0}y)$
\4 By the prior formulas for intensity of light, the intensity at any point is approximated as $I(x, y) \approx I_0cos^2(\frac{kdy}{2r_0}) = I_0cos^2(kdsin(\frac{\theta}{2}))$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the perpendicular axis to the slits to the point
\1 Speakers use sound meant to go to each ear through headphones, made to produce the proper intensities and depth, in a wide area creating cross-talk
\2 As a result, in theory, the cross-talk sound can be cancelled out by the same negated sound from the other speaker, adding a phase shift to cancel it out, used for surround sound
\2 On the other hand, this can create a faint disturbance, and relies on being placed precidely between
\end{outline*}
\section{Freegarde Chapter 9 - Fraunhofer Diffraction}
\begin{outline*}
\1 While interference is the superposition of several possible wave paths, diffraction is the interaction of a high number of wave paths, such that the interference fringes are a diffraction pattern
\1 Fraunhofer diffraction is observed in the image plane of the source, where there is a large number of real optical paths with the same wavelength and amplitude
\2 Fresnel diffraction are those with close image planes, such that the range of angles is wider, such that it and Bragg diffraction show interference and diffraction synonymous
\2 Due to the low range of angles, the angle can be viewed as fairly constant within a region, such that the amplitude change is negligable
\1 This is analyzed, similar to Young, by a slit, but rather than several of infinitessimal width, a single slit of the same net width, projecting onto some image plane d away
\2 As a result, when observed at some angle from the slit, $\theta$, each wave originating at position y within the slit travelled longer by $-ysin(\theta)$ from that of the center of the slit
\3 Thus, the phasor for this point is $\psi(y) = \psi_0e^{-ikysin\theta}$, integrated for the width of the slit, such that $\psi(\theta) = a\psi_0sinc(\alpha)$ where $sinc(\alpha) = \frac{sin(\alpha)}{\alpha} = \frac{sin(\frac{ka}{2}sin(\theta))}{\frac{ka}{2}sin(\theta)}$, such that a is the width
\1 This can also be applied in two dimensions, producing a circular aperture, or Airy pattern, defined by $I(r) = I_0(\frac{2J_1(\alpha)}{\alpha})^2$, where $J_1(\alpha)$ is a Bessel function of the first kind
\1 Fraunhofer diffraction can be viewed as a Fresnel curve, cut off at the ends, such that only a small middle portion is relevent, becoming flatting as the slit is narrowed or the distance is greater
\2 On the other hand, a non-centered observation point cuts a different portion of the curve, forming a circular phasor formation, due to the angle range still being small, but at a greater magnitude angle
\3 These phasor sums for each angle can be graphed, producing a cochleoid, or a spiral from the horizontal sum, shrinking toward the origin in a spiral as the angle magnitude decreases
\2 As a result, unlike Fresnel diffraction which uses the entire curve, Fraunhofer diffraction gains a pure horizontal phasor near the middle
\3 This results in the phasors becoming more circularly added as it progresses, such that the amplitude decreases proportionally to the angle
\2 Increasing the width of the slit as a result causes more extreme reactions, such that the amplitude at the center is greater, but additional angles of the phasors change faster, creating a planar wave
\1 Since for some wavefront, when hitting a surface, it combines to form high amplitude only at the 0-angle from the source, called the Dirac $\delta$-function
\2 As a result, at any non-zero angle, the diffracted amplitude is equal and opposite to that resulting from the obstructed sources, called Babinet's Principle
\2 This allows easier calculation of diffraction patterns, and was used to prove that the Airy diffraction pattern and Poisson's bright spot are the same, proving the lack of partical behavior alone
\1 The diffraction grating is a series of narrow slits, either transmissive or reflective when combined with a plane mirror
\2 This then results in a wavefunction with respect to viewing position angle, similar to that for a wide single-slit, except with a t(y) transmission multiplier either 0 or 1 for each point, $\psi(\theta) = \int^{\frac{a}{2}}_{-\frac{a}{2}} \psi_0t(y)e^{-ikysin\theta}dy$
\3 Due to this being equal for each slit, except with a phase multiplier based on the slit height, it is written $\psi(\theta) = e^{-iky_1sin(\theta)}\int^{\frac{w}{2}}_{\frac{-w}{2}} \psi_0t(y)e^{-ikysin\theta}dy + ... + e^{-iky_nsin(\theta)}\int^{\frac{w}{2}}_{\frac{-w}{2}} \psi_0t(y)e^{-ikysin\theta}dy = (\sum^\frac{N}{2}_{n = -\frac{N}{2}} e^{-ikndsin(\theta)})\psi_0\int^{\frac{w}{2}}_{-\frac{w}{2}} e^{-ikysin\theta}dy$, where N+1 is the number of slits and d is the distance between the centers of each slit
\3 This creates an infinite geometric series for the first component, such that $\sum^\frac{N}{2}_{n = -\frac{N}{2}} e^{-ikndsin(\theta)} = \frac{sin(\frac{N+1}{2}kdsin(\theta))}{sin(\frac{1}{2}kdsin(\theta))}$
\3 This can be combined with the expression for the integral found for a single slit, providing the function $\psi(\theta) = \frac{sin(\frac{N+1}{2}kdsin(\theta))}{sin(\frac{1}{2}kdsin(\theta))}\psi_0d\frac{sin(\frac{1}{2}kw\sin(\theta))}{\frac{1}{2}kwsin(\theta)}$
\2 This produces a series of narrow peaks when the denominator approaches 0, such that $\frac{kdsin\theta}{2} = m\pi$, or $dsin\theta = m\lambda$, such that m is the diffraction order
\3 As a result, the beam of light is dispersed at each order of diffraction, such that the spectrum can be recorded

\section{Freegarde Chapter 10 - Longitudinal Waves}
\begin{outline*}
\1 Sound waves are one-dimensional longitudinal motion/compressions and refractions in an elastic medium, such that it follows Hooke's Law, visualized as the medium uniformly filling a cylinder
\2 The wave motion results in some section of the medium both changing the location and the thickness
\2 As a result, for some element from x to $x + \delta x$, when displaced, it occupies $x + \epsilon$ to $x + \delta x + \epsilon + \delta\epsilon$
\3 Tension is written by $T = EA\frac{\delta\epsilon}{\delta x}$, where the mass is given by $\delta m = \rho A \delta x$, where E is Young's modulus and $\rho$ is density
\3 As a result, the difference of the tension on both sides is the force on the mass element as a whole, related to Newton's Second Law, dividing both sides by $\delta x$ and using the limit as it approaches 0
\3 This provides the wave equation, $\rho\frac{\partial^2 \epsilon}{\partial t^2} = E\frac{\partial^2 \epsilon}{\partial x^2}$
\2 As a result, for some sound wave, $v_p = \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}}$
\1 **MISSING SPEED IN AIR/PRESSURE (10.2.1-2)**
\end{outline*}
\section{Miscellaneous Wave Notes}
All waves can be viewed as the sum of a sinusoidal traveling wave, such that $\psi(x, t) = Acos(k(x-vt) + \phi) = Acos(kx - \omega t + \phi)$ by forier series of normal modes

$\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial t^2} = v^2\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2}$ is the general wave equation

Since $sinkxsin\omega t = \frac{1}{2}(cos(kx - \omega t) - cos(kx + \omega t))$, it can be written as travelling waves
For a string attached at the ends, since $\psi(0, t) = Asin\phi sin(\omega t + \theta) = 0$ for a standing wave, and $\psi(L, t) = Asin(kL + \phi)sin(\omega t + \theta) = 0$, kL is limited to specific values for a standing wave to occur
v independent for a string, such that $f\lambda$ is constant, $f_n = \frac{nv}{2L} = nf_1$, where $f_1$ is the fundemental frequency on the string
Fundemental frequency is the frequency of a standing wave equal to half a wavelength

$\psi(x, t) = \sum a_n sin(\frac{n\pi x}{L})cos(\frac{n\pi vt}{L})$, represented as a fourier series, equal to just the sine component at t = 0, from n = $a_1$ to $a_{\infty}$

In addition, it proceeds to get more rounded as it goes along, due to damping causing the higher frequencies to fade?? or vice versa

Each stationary standing wave point is a normal node, while normal string waves are triangular, they can be approximated by a standing wave curve, getting closer as the fourier series is allow to extend to infinity

Three terms is generally enough to approximate a string properly
Superposition of electronic states leads to electrons in many distinct states simultaneously until observed

Energy in Wave Motion - $K = \frac{1}{2}\Delta mv^2  = \frac{1}{2} \mu \Delta x (\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}^2$

For string, $\Delta L = \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta \psi)^2} - \Delta x = \Delta x (\sqrt{1 - (\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x})^2} - 1)$

$\sqrt{1 + x^2} = 1 + \frac{1}{2}x^2$
$U = T\Delta L$, $E = T(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x})^2 \Delta x$

Energy can be expressed in normal nodes, electromagnetic waves in powerpoint

Poynting vector in the direction of propogation of light, equal to the cross product of the electric and magnetic fields
$E = E_0 cos(kx - \omega t), B = B_0 cos(kx - \omega t)$
$E_0 = cB_0, \vec{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0}E\times B$, S = poynting, $|S| = \frac{1}{\mu_0}EB = \frac{P}{A}$, $I = <|S|> = \frac{1}{\mu_0}<EB> = \frac{1}{c\mu_0}<E^2>$
v = c = $\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}}$
At some angle, total internal reflection takes place, at which point there is no refraction, only reflection, only when moving from high index of refraction to low
Called critical angle, when the transmission angle is parallel to the medium boundary

$c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon \mu_0}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\kappa \epsilon_0 \mu_0}}, n = \sqrt{\kappa} > 1$

Mirage is caused by hot air having a lower angle of refraction, such that light bends, allowing two images of the same object, one down, one straight
It is turned upside down due to the top part being bent such that the ray is below the unbent ray of the bottom

Polarization in the direction of oscillation, using a filter barrier to remove all those not oscillating in the right direction
Can be done by a metal grating, the electric charges changing to cancel out the field with electric fields in that orientation
Can also be done by long stretched chain molecules, acting similar to a metal due to fairly mobile electrons

Intensity = $\frac{EB}{\mu} = \frac{E^2}{c\mu_0}$

45 degrees then 45 degrees again of a polarization field can shift the light into components, such that it can pass through the two perpendicular filters

I unpolarized $I_0$ -> Filter, $I = \frac{<E^2>}{c\mu_0} = \frac{E_0^2<cos^2\theta>}{c\mu_0} = I_0<cos^2\theta> = \frac{I_0}{2}$

Scattering - Rayleigh (Main form, $\lambda >> D$), causing electron to oscillate, producing new wave as atom rotates, $I = kf^4$, such that more blue scattered than red, causing sky colors

Oscillating dipoles produce the partially polarized light from reflection

Wavelets caused by oscillating electrons at the same rate, such that frequency is the same, just velocity and wavelength different

Backtravelling waves are canceled out with an infinite sized plane wave with an infinite number of wavefronts

\section{Helliwell Chapter 1 - Inertial Frames and Classical Mechanics}
\begin{outline*}
\1 Frames of reference are necessary to describe motion, creating a coordinate axis, easiest to measure motion when inertial frames
\2 Inertial frames of reference are those where Newton's First Law is true, found to be those not accelerating or rotating relative to any other inertial frame
\3 This is compensated for on Earth by local reference frames only being negligably rotating and accelerating with the Earth
\2 This allows infinite inertial frames of reference, moving with different velocities
\2 Newton's other laws are only valid for describing motion by inertial observers
\1 Events are defined as something that happens at an instant in time and in space, requiring both to measure position
\2 The measurement of position of an event depends on the frame of reference
\2 For some frame F, and some frame F' moving with velocity v with respect to F, some event at (x, y, z, t), x' = x - vt, y' = y, z' = z, t' = t, called the Galilean transformation of F to F'
\3 Within a Galilean transformation, length and time intervals are the same between frames
\3 It is noted that to measure length of an object, the two event measurements must be simultaneous for the lengths to be measured equally, and clocks must be synchronized
\2 As a result of Galilean transformations, space and time are distinct and do not affect motion as a result
\2 It also follows that $v'_x = v_x - v$ and $a'_x = a_x$, providing the relationship between velocities and accelerations in different frames
\3 Since mass is assumed to also be a constant quantity, force is independent of frame of reference as a result within inertial frames
\2 Thus, within classical mechanics, it is assumed that there is no perferred frame of reference, also called the principle of relativity
\1 The reference frame such that the center of mass remains fixed in the frame for system momentum of 0 is called the center of mass frame, giving infinite rotated center of mass frames for any system
\1 Classical physics assumes the validity of Newton's Laws, both in terms of force and momentum, as well as the universal conservation of energy
\end{outline*}
\section{Helliwell Chapter 2 - Light and the Ether}
\begin{outline*}
\1 In the 1800s, it was thought light required a medium to propogate in, called the ether, existing in all environments, assuming light moving at c for a frame of reference of the ether at rest
\1 The aberration of light is the annual apparent circular motion of the stars in the sky, due to the telescope having to be pointed at an angle to view a star above, approximately $tan(\theta) = \theta = \frac{v}{c} = \frac{30 * 10^3 m/s}{c} = 10^{-4} rad$
\2 This is due to the motion of the telescope due to the rotation of the earth in the time it takes the light to reach the telescope due to the rotation of the Earth
\2 As the star moves overhead twice per year, it requires angling the telescope in opposite directions due to the revolution of the Earth
\2 As a result, the ether cannot be moving at the same speed as the rotation of the Earth, or the telescope would not require being angled
\1 The Michelson-Morley Experiment tried to measure the velocity of the ether, sending light through a separator in perpendicular directions towards a mirror, travelling separate distances to each mirror, interfering to the observer
\2 This is very sensitive to changes in distance due to the small wavelength of visible light
\2 As a result, the ether would change the time it takes the light to move back, changing the relative velocity, such that $t_{longitudinal} = \frac{d}{c - v} + \frac{d}{c + v} = \frac{2d_l}{c(1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2})}$
\3 For the transverse movement, it would move in a triangle relative to the ether, such that $t_{transverse} = \frac{2d_t}{c\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$
\2 This is then measured with the perpendicular setup with the same distances, to differentiate the effect of the different distances and the ether movement
\1 It was found that the ether was not moving at the surface of the Earth at a velocity opposite the orbital speed of the Earth *such that it is at rest relative to space, apparently showing the ether movement on Earth, contradicting the aberration effect
\end{outline*}
\section{Helliwell Chapter 3 - Einstein's Postulates}
\begin{outline*}
\1 Einstein's postulates of special relativity made up for the lack of an ether frame of reference for the speed of light, found to also not be relative to the emitting object, 
\2 These stated that absolute uniform motion cannot be detected and that the velocity of light does not depend on the velocity of its source relative to the observer, both only applying in an inertial frame of reference
\3 The first implied that there was no preferred inertial frame of reference by which all motion is compared, such that the laws of physics must be valid for all frames
\3 The second is generally not true for other phenomena, such as sound, in which it is only independent of the source when the observer is at rest with respect to the air/medium
\2 As a result, light does not depend on the source velocity, and by the first postulate, for any inerial frame of reference of the observer, it is the same, such that the velocity of the observer with respect to the source doesn't change the velocity of the light
\1 For an explosion of light moving from the coinciding origins at t = 0, when F' moving at v with respect to F, it will appear to an observer in each frame to be moving in a circle at the same rate from the origin with respect to their frame
\2 On the other hand, an explosion of sound will only move out spherically from the origin in the frame with velocity 0 with respect to the air, such that in F', the origin from which the sound moves will appear to be moving with velocity -v

\section{Helliwell Chapter 4 - Time Dilation}
\begin{outline*}
\1 Light clocks are those that flash each time they detect the reflection of their previous pulse, such that $\Delta t = \frac{2D}{c}$, where D is the distance to the mirror
\2 For clocks on a moving vehicle, they function in the same manner by the first principle, moving at the same rate as each other, but must function at the same rate as other clocks of any type on the same vehicle
\2 The rate of the clock for those on the vehicle is by the previous formula, but for observers of the clock as the ship moves, stationed perpendicular to the motion
\3 Thus, the light has to move both the distance the vehicle is moving in that time, while moving towards the mirror, such that $\Delta t = \frac{2D}{\sqrt{c^2 - v^2}}$
\3 As a result, the time between each tick appears to be longer for clocks on the ship to a stationary observer than for a relative stationary clock
\1 As a result, it is shown that $t_{moving} = t_{stationary}\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}$, such that since all clocks move slower as a result, including technological and biological, time moves slower on the moving vehicle, called dilation, such that time is not universal
\2 This formula assumes that the velocity of the vehicle/the relative velocity of frames of reference is unable to be greater than the speed of light, acting as a maximum speed for the reasoning
\1 It is difficult to measure time dilation due to the time required for the light from the clock to reach the viewer giving a delay, instead placing synchronized clocks at both endpoints
\2 A third moving clock is then synchronized with the first when it is at the same location, observing the time on the third and second clock as it passes it
\2 This has been observed by the decay of unstable particles from high energy colliders or cosmic rays, by the movement of galaxies to/from the Earth, and in satellites/airplanes
\3 Particles such as muons decay in their own time frame within $2.2 \mu s$, but are found to reach the planet in cosmic rays due to time dilation, lasting longer in the detectors reference frame, acting as a clock
\3 Muons are created due to pion decay, which in turns are produced by cosmic protons colliding with the air, testing the muons at high altitude versus low at 0.995c approximately, finding they survive approximately $8.8 \pm 0.8$x longer, close to the calculated $8.4 \pm 2$x
\end{outline*}
\section{Helliwell Chapter 5 - Length Contraction}
\begin{outline*}
\1 Time dilation assumed that transverse lengths were not changed by motion, found to be true by the first postulate, due to this causing a nonsymmetric effect depending on the frame of reference
\2 This is proven by the wooden stick knife experiment, one running toward the other such that if the length changed, it would either be sliced off or slice off the blade of the other from the stick, showing a preferred frame of reference
\1 Longitudinal lengths, on the other hand, are affected, such that if measured for some clock moving with velocity v along some length D, the time it takes the clock to reach the end of the stick would then be $\Delta t = \frac{D}{v\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$, due to time moving slower for the moving clock
\2 Within the clock's frame of reference, the clock will still state the same value when the stick has passed, such that either the velocity of the stick depends on the frame, or the length of the stick depends on the velocity
\3 Since velocity is independent of frame of reference, due to the first postulate, the distance depends on the frame of reference
\3 Thus, within the clock's frame of reference, the time for the stick to pass is distance divided by velocity, while in the sticks frame, time is moving slower for the clock
\2 Thus, Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction of longitudinal lengths is designated by $d_{moving} = d_{rest}\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}$ for some object
\1 This explains the fact that for those moving at some velocity, since the clocks move slower, they appear to travel distances in shorter times, rather travelling shorter distances
\1 For a light clock sending light in the direction of motion, sending a distance D when not moving, $\Delta t = \frac{2D}{c\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$ is the time between each tick, equal to that of a transverse sending clock
\2 This is due to the stationary observer viewing the length D as $D\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}$, such that on the ship, less time is passing, but on the stationary frame, the light is travelling a shorter distance
\end{outline*}
\section{Helliwell Chapter 6 - Simultaneity}
\begin{outline*}
\1 Relativity also causes the order of events, or simultaneity, to be relative, rather than definite, such as that seen when two ships move in opposite direction, triggering an explosion on each side as the stationary observer sees the head of one reach the tail of the other
\2 For an observer inside the ship, the light from the direction towards which they are moving would reach them before the light from the direction they are moving from, although the explosions occured when they were halfway
\2 This can be explained from the perspective of an observer in the ship, as the other ship appears shorter, such that the explosion of reaching its tail must happen before vice versa
\1 As a result of the lack of simultaneity between reference frames, clocks must be synchronized in each specific reference frame
\2 This cannot be done by a single observer, aligning the time of one with that of another at some other location due to the lag it takes the light to reach the observer causing a difference in times
\2 This can also not be done by moving clocks to a different location after synchronizing them all together, due to time dilation of transport causing them to run slightly slower based on the distance and velocity of transport, unless precisely synchronizing transport as well
\2 Clocks are properly synchronized by a light flash when $t_1 = 0$, setting the second clock when the light reaches to $t_2 = \frac{d}{c}$
\3 This can also be done similarly by a lightbulb in between, setting both to t = 0 as the light reaches each of the clocks
\2 On the other hand, by this method for a moving observer with stationary clocks, the clocks appear to be moving in the opposite direction with a contracted length between them
\3 Since they are moving, the flash of light hits one of the clocks before it reaches the other, due to one moving towards the wavefront, the other away
\3 This time difference can be calculated, such that the time until it reaches the first clock is $t = \frac{D\sqrt(1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}{2(c + v)}$, due to the contracted distance the light travels in the clock's frame of reference
\4 On the other hand, the other clock has a denominator of $2(c - v)$, such that the time difference is $\Delta t = \frac{Dv\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}{c^2 - v^2}$
\4 Since that is within the frame of reference of the clocks, it is multiplied by the Lorentz factor, such that when the clock moving from the light waves is at t = 0, the other is at $t = \frac{vD}{c^2}$, giving the time lag factor for clocks in the same frame
\4 The clock in the front is moving from the light wave, called the leading clock, is the clock with a time lag
\3 As a result, distance and velocity create a time lag, such that simultaneity depends on frame of reference, worse by distance
\end{outline*}
\section{Helliwell Chapter 7 - Paradoxes}
\begin{outline*}
\1 Paradoxes are apparent impossibilities within relativity, aiding understanding of the concepts once the logical contradictions are resolved
\1 The clock speed paradox is the idea that if a clock is apparently slow to one observer, and yet to an observer in the frame of reference of that clock, a clock in the first observers frame of reference appears slow to them
\2 This is resolved by the fact that the rate of the moving clock is measured by two synchronized clocks within the stationary frame, but from the moving frame, the two clocks are not synchronized
\2 This is shown by two clocks in frame A, apparently taking $t = \frac{D}{V}$ for the clock in frame B to reach the second, reading that it took it less time by the Lorentz factor
\3 Within frame B, it took the time read on the second clock, due to the distance travelled being contracted
\3 The time on each clock when the moving clock reaches it does not depend on the frame of reference, but the clocks do not appear synchronized within the B frame, but rather that the second clock is at $t = \frac{VD}{c^2}$ when the first is at t = 0
\3 As a result, the time that passes within the A frame according to the B frame is the apparent time in A multipled by the Lorentz Factor squared, taking into account both the time dilation and length contraction
\4 When adding this to the initial value of the second clock from the perspective of the B frame, it reads the same time as in A, such that time still slowed in the clocks in the A frame apparently
\2 The Twin Paradox is an extension of this, caused by a twin changing to a near-light speed, then slowing back, such that when in the same frame of reference, one will have to have had more time pass than the other, although both could argue their clock is faster
\3 This is resolved by the fact that the moving twin is accelerating at certain points, such that the rules of special relativity do not apply
\4 This is due to acceleration not being relative, but rather able to be measured by the force on an object, such that the accelerating frame does not have the formula apply
\3 On the other hand, within the nonaccelerating frame, the rules apply, such that the faster clock exists within this frame, due to the rules applying normally
\1 The meterstick length paradox is similar to the clock speed paradox, instead about the idea that each meterstick appears longer to those in its frame of reference than others
\2 The length is measured by simultaneous measurement of both sides of the moving stick by stationary observers in frame A, but observers in frame B would see those as non-simultaneous
\2 Since the second clock within frame B lags behind by $\frac{VD}{c^2}$ in terms of the A frame, the meterstick in B appears to an observer in B to have been measured shorter than it actually is
\3 The same logic applies to a meterstick within the A frame, such that it will appear to an observer in A that B is measuring the stick shorter than it should be
\1 Special relativity also causes a problem with rigid bodies, preserving the distance between any two points, such that it acts as a point mass, due to length contraction and by limiting the speed of an effect to less than the speed of light, such that a force won't reach all points simultaneously
\end{outline*}
\section{Helliwell Chapter 8 - Lorentz Transformation}
\begin{outline*}
\1 The Lorentz Transformation is a reformulation of the Galilean transformation applying the concepts of relativity to it, such that F' is moving with velocity v relative to F
\2 By the Galilean transformation, for an observer in F, x' = x - vt, but the distance is contracted, such that an observer in F' observes distance x', in F observes $x'\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = (x - vt)\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}$
\2 Just as in a Galilean transformation, y' = y and z' = z, due to being perpendicular to the direction of motion
\2 For the time transformation, it is assumed the clocks are synchronized at t = 0 as they are at the same location, such that $t = t'\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}$ 
\3 For some following clock within F', it is leading by $\frac{vx}{c^2}$, since the distance from the origin initially is independent of frame, such that for some clock at (x, y, z) in F', the relationship between F and F' is $t = t'\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} + \frac{vx}{c^2}$
\2 This transformation is reversible, such that F can be viewed as moving with -v from the stationary F' for the same result
\1 This can be taken for t' where x = x' for all t in the F frame to get time dilation, $x_1 - x_2$ at the same time within the F frame to get the formula for length contraction, and $t_1' - t_2'$ for simultaneous time measurements ($t_1 = t_2$) in the same frame based on location
\1 It is found by differentiating that $\frac{dx'}{dt'} = \frac{\frac{dx'}{dt}}{\frac{dt'}{dt}}$, similar for y and z, such that $v_x' = \frac{v_x - v}{1 - \frac{vv_x}{c^2}}$ and $v_{y/z}' = \frac{v_{y/z}\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}{1 - \frac{vv_x}{c^2}}$
\2 As a result, as the speed of light approaches infinity, it becomes the Galilean transformation, but otherwise, it depends on both $v_x$ and the velocity on the axis itself
\2 It is also calculated from this that $v_{F'} = c$ if $v_F = c$ for all v between the frames of reference, such that it follows Einsteins second postulate
\2 It also follows from these equations that for any velocity greater than the speed of light, the value is imaginary, such that it is not possible
\end{outline*}
\section{Helliwell Chapter 9 - Spacetime}
\begin{outline*}
\1 Within relativistic physics, distance and time depend on each other, warping together as the frame of reference changes, such that it can be viewed as a coordinate system, called Minkowski spacetime
\2 Lorenz transformations are viewed as a rotation of the coordinate system, though not following the same rotation equations as a normal coordinate plane, using ct as the time axis such that it is the same units
\2 This allowed general relativity, based on the idea of curved spacetime, rather than Euclidean perpendicular axes
\2 As a result, for some light ray on the 2D graph of time and space in one dimension, it appears as the lines y = x and y = -x, both moving forward in time, intersecting at the origin, forming the locus of light rays
\3 With a second spacial dimension, it forms a light cone as the locus of light rays, all at the same angle to the time axis, and with a third spacial dimension, forming a sphere changing in size over time, still called the light cone
\3 For any particle, it moves within the cone, through the origin, staying inside due to moving less than at the speed of light, drawn over time called the worldline
\1 Thus, the absolute past for the particle is defined as all events on or within the lower light cone, while the absolute future are those of the upper light cone, due to only those events being able to influence or be influenced by the particle
\2 The relative past and future of the particle are those taking place outside the cone, depending on the frame of reference velocity relative to the particle, to determine the time of the event relative to the particle
\2 All observers will agree on an event within the absolute past, due to the effects being present in any frame of reference
\1 For some standard displacement vector in 3D space, it is noted that even if the coordinate plane is rotated, the magnitude is still constant, called invariant
\2 Similarly, the position vector in spacetime is denoted by $(x_\mu), \mu = 0, 1, 2, 3 = (ct, x, y, z)$, called a four-vector, defined such that the magnitude is constant in all frames
\3 This is found to not be true for the Euclidean space magnitude vector formula, but rather with the magnitude defined for four-vectors as $\sqrt{-c^2t^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2} = |(x_\mu)|$, such that Minkowski space is called a pseudo-Euclidean space
\4 Similarly, the magnitude is given the term, four-scalars, remaining constant under rotation
\3 This is due to the fact that longer time results in longer length, rather than shorter length as the alternate formula would imply
\2 Displacement within spacetime is called the spacetime interval, such that the magnitude is the same within all frames of reference
\3 It is noted that it can be both positive or negative, and may be zero even if the location of the events are not the same
\3 For some events with spacetime interval magnitude greater than 0 is called spacelike, with spacial separation greater than $c\Delta t$
\4 As a result, there is some frame of reference, such that $\Delta t = 0$, such that the events are simultaneous, where the distance between in that frame is the proper length, only able to be found in a spacelike interval
\3 For some events with spacetime interval magnitude less than 0 is called timelike, such that it is possible to find a frame of reference where $\Delta x = \Delta y = \Delta z = 0$, such that the proper time can be measured
\3 For some events with a null spacetime interval ($(\Delta s)^2 = 0$), it is possible for them to be at different coordinates, such that they must exist along some specific light ray
\4 Thus, $\Delta x = \pm c\Delta t$, and there is no frame of reference in which they are simultaneous events, or in which they are at the same spacial location
